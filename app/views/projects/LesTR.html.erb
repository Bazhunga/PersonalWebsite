						<div class="descSubtitle">What it is</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>
								For our 2nd year Engineering Design Robotics course, a team of 3 of us was tasked to create, from scratch, a quality-assurance machine that can evaluate 7-LED hexagonal headlights. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">How it works</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>
								The brain, programmed in assembly, operates motors and solenoid clickers to rotate lights into position and evaluate their LEDS. It gathers information from photoresistors and microswitches and evaluates whether lights were present and if they exceeded the light threshold that indicates a pass. All components are mounted to a wooden-aluminum chassis. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Users will be able to see which lights are faulty and exactly which LEDs are not up to par. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">Inspiration of design</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p> 
								We drew inspiration from assembly lines, where many complex machines intertwine to completely make and test a product as simple as a bottle of coke to something as complex as the engine of a car. Our machine was designed to be like a component of an assembly line, with a rotating platform to continuously test lights for faults.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">Improvements</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>
								When it comes to testing for failure, speed and accuracy are key. A stronger motor with greater torque, like a large stepper, would have been able to bring the hefty 7 lights into position more fluidly. Higher tech, like lasers, would've added to the accuracy of light placement detection, rather than a bulky microswitch.
							</p>
							<p>	
								If our machine were to be a part of the assembly line, it must have an autofeeder to load the tray and a popper to dump the tested lights to appropriately marked "pass" and "fail" bins.
