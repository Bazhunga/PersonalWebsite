						<div class="descSubtitle">What it is</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>
							Using an android-powered phone and 3 Onyx Beacons, we're able to track the location of the device in terms of x and y coordinates by obtaining the distance to the 3 beacons and then trilaterating the device's position. These coordinate pairs are then uploaded to the DB2 database provided by IBM Bluemix, where a "heat" map can be generated. 
							</p>
							<p>The hotspots indicate where the phone has been positioned for the longest. The spots get redder the more position points there are around the area. This visualization of data can give way to behavioural analysis and consequently, player improvement</p>

							<p>We made this during SportsHack14 to push forward the idea of tracking players on any given playing field to gather rich data about player, and subsequently, team behaviour during a match. 
							</p>
							
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">Motivation</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>Currently, player tracking and heat-mapping is only saved for large stadiums and well-known teams, like Brazil during the World Cup. Large cameras and complicated setups yield data about the behaviour of players and the team as a whole. We felt that such a rich source of data should be accessible to any team and any sport. </p>
							<p>The setup up consist of affixing beacons to the outer perimeter of an arena and assigning each beacon a cartesian coordinate in a 2D plane. The app on the android device, worn on the player's person will do all the tracking and uploading of player position to the database</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">So what's done with the data?</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							<p>The simple data, coordinates and a timestamp, can be used to create a heat map of one player or an entire team throughout a small interval of the game or the entire match. Previously unseen trends can then be revealed!</p>
							<p>The data can see many uses. Coaches can use it as a resource to understand the players more deeply. Players themselves can have an instant replay of the game at their fingertips to improve themselves. Lastly, heat maps can be made for increased viewer comprehension of the game.  
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">Improvements to be made</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							At the moment, players would have to strap on an Android device for tracking. This is bulky and likely uncomfortable. In the future, this can be expanded to wifi-capable smartwatches that can easily worn on the wrist. 
						</div>
						<div class="descSubtitle">Source Code</div>
						<div class="descElab">
							We'll release the source code soon! We're still ironing some issues out.
